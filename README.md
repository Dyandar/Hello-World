# Hello-World
My first little project
Hi I'm David. I come from Colombia and I want to learn about coding and software. I've been working as a technician operator in Vente-privee, and my work is interesting because I learn everyday. This time I write a list with possible configurations to solve an alert:

# Alerts:
- PROCS WARNING {Icinga > Activity_log > CLICK NAME >Services-Inherited from Linux > Check_total_process_nrpe > NRPE Command- [check_process]                                                                                                                    [check_process_hot]                                                                                                                            [check_process_hot_and_spicy] }

- CHECK_NRPE {Remote desktop connection > Adm. Tools > services > compare_nsclient.ini  > Notepad - Run as administrator > copy_nsclient.ini > Save as nsclient.ini > restart}
